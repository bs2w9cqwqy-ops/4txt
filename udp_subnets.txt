# =============================================================================
# IP subnets for UDP-only VPN routing
# Format: CIDR (e.g., 91.108.4.0/22)
# TCP traffic to these subnets will NOT go through VPN, only UDP
# Use for services where low latency matters for regular traffic,
# but voice/video calls should go through VPN
